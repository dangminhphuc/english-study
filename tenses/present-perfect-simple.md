(?)  Have/Has + S +       V-past participle ?
```

## Use

1. Situations that started in the past and are still true.
2. Completed actions at a time in the past which is not mentioned.
3. Completed actions where the important thing is the result now.

```text
Completed actions in the past, they are:
 |— still true now
 |— happened at an unspecified time
 |— have a result that’s important in the present.
```

## Watch out

1. Don’t use Present Perfect when you say when something happened.
    - If you mention exact time (yesterday, last week, in 2020, etc.), use Past Simple!
    - Present Perfect is vague about time, but if you say when, it's Past Simple all the way.

2. Don’t use Past Simple if the action is still connected to now
    - If the time isn’t clear or the result matters now, use Present Perfect!
