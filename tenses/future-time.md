# Future time

- Present simple
- Present continuous
- will
- be going to

## Present Simple

1. Timetables

- I get up at 7AM
- I join daily meeting at 10.15AM every workday.
- I get off work at 6PM

## Present Continuous

> S + tobe + V-ing

1. Arrangements

### Watch out

1. Things we want to do in the future but have not arranged are called 'intentions'. We do not use the present continuous for intentions. We use be going to instead.
    - I’m becoming an explorer when I grow up.

2. We do not use the present continuous for predictions. We use will or be going to instead.
    - Do you think you're enjoying your trip to Berlin next week?

### Examples

- I’m playing billiards in tomorrow.
- I’m cooking on the weekend.
- I’m meeting my wife today.

## will

> will + bare infinitive | will + be + V3/ed

### Form

```text
(+) S + will +       V
(-) S + will + not + V
(?)     Will + S   + V ?
```

### Use

1. Facts about the future: based on general knowledge, rules or science.
    - The sun will rise tomorrow at 6AM.
    - In the winter, the weather will be cold in the evening.
2. Predictions: based on opinion or belief.
    - I think it will rain tomorrow.
    - Being a software engineer will be difficult because AI is growing more and more.
3. Offers and requests
    - I’ll help you wash the dishes after you’re done cooking.
4. Decisions made now
    - I’ll go back home now.

### Watch out

1. With offers which are questions, we use shall with I and we.
2. We do not use will for arrangements.

### Examples

- AI will assist developers in release product quickly.
- AI is smart, but AI will not replace completely humans.
- You’ll go back home later; you need fulfill tasks today.
- Shall I help you clean the dishes?

## be going to

```text
(+) S + be     going to + V
(-) S + be not going to + V
(?) Be + S   + going to + V ?
```
