# Future time

- Present simple
- Present continuous
- will
- be going to

## Present Simple

1. **Timetables/Schedules**: used for future events that are fixed by an official timetable, calendar, or schedule — things we **don’t control**.
    - I join the daily meeting at 10.15AM today.
    - I get off work at 5PM next Friday.

## Present Continuous

> S + tobe + V-ing

1. **Arrangements**: used for future plans we have personally arranged or agreed upon — things **we can control** or have organized with others.
    - I'm joining the daily meeting at 10.15AM today.
    - I'm getting off work at 5PM next Friday.

### Watch out

1. Things we want to do in the future but have not arranged are called 'intentions'. We do not use **the present continuous** for intentions. We use **be going to** instead.
    - (x) I’m becoming an explorer when I grow up.
    - (v) I'm going to become an explorer when I grow up.

2. We do not use the present continuous for predictions. We use will or **be going to** instead.
    - (x) Do you think you're enjoying your trip to Berlin next week?
    - (v) Do you think you’re going to enjoy your trip to Berlin next week?

### Examples

- I’m playing billiards in tomorrow.
- I’m cooking on the weekend.
- I’m meeting my wife today.

## will

> will + bare infinitive | will + be + V3/ed

```text
(+) S + will +       V
(-) S + will + not + V
(?)     Will + S   + V ?
```

### Use

1. Facts about the future: based on general knowledge, rules or science.
    - The sun will rise tomorrow at 6AM.
    - In the winter, the weather will be cold in the evening.
2. Predictions: based on opinion or belief.
    - I think it will rain tomorrow.
    - Being a software engineer will be difficult because AI is growing more and more.
3. Offers and requests
    - I’ll help you wash the dishes after you’re done cooking.
4. Decisions made now
    - I’ll go back home now.

### Watch out

1. With offers which are questions, we use shall with I and we.
2. We do not use will for arrangements.

### Examples

- AI will assist developers in release product quickly.
- AI is smart, but AI will not replace completely humans.
- You’ll go back home later; you need fulfill tasks today.
- Shall I help you clean the dishes?
